## Overview

An R package for working with motion capture data based on the C++ library [EZC3D](https://github.com/pyomeca/ezc3d).

## Background

C3D (<https://www.c3d.org/>) is a file format for biomechanical data, namely motion capture recordings with additional analog data (e.g., from force plates or electromyography).

The `c3dr` package allows to read, analyze and write C3D files in R (<https://www.r-project.org/about.html>), a programming language popular for statistical analyses and data visualization. `c3dr` is build on the open-source C++ library EZC3D (<https://github.com/pyomeca/ezc3d>).

For more information, read the [Get Started](https://smnnlt.github.io/c3dr/articles/c3dr.html) vignette.

## Installation

Install `c3dr` from GitHub:

```{r}
#| eval: false
if (!require(pak)) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("smnnlt/c3dr")
```

## Usage

### Read Data

```{r}
library(c3dr)

# get example data. Insert your file path instead, e.g.
# path <- "folder/myfilename.c3d"
path <- c3d_example()

# import data
d <- c3d_read(path)
d

# structure of the imported object
str(d, max.level = 1)

# read point data
p <- c3d_data(d)
p[1:5, 1:5]

# alternative long data format
p_long <- c3d_data(d, format = "long")
p_long[1:5, 1:5]

# read analog data
a <- c3d_analog(d)
a[1:5, 41:43]

# read data from first force platform
d$forceplatform[[1]]$forces[1:5, ]

# write data to a new c3d file
# c3d_write(d, "newfile.c3d")
```
