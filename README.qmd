## Overview

An R package for working with motion capture data based on the C++ library [EZC3D](https://github.com/pyomeca/ezc3d).

## Background

## Installation

Install `c3dr` from GitHub:

```{r}
#| eval: false
if (!require(pak)) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("smnnlt/c3dr")
```

## Usage

### Import Data

```{r}
#| collapse: true
#| comment: "#>"
library(c3dr)

# get example data. Insert your file path instead
path <- c3d_example() 

# import data
d <- c3d_read(path)
d

# structure of the imported object
str(d, max.level = 1)

# read point data
p <- c3d_data(d)
p[1:5, 1:5]

# alternative long data format
p_long <- c3d_data(d, format = "long")
p_long[1:5, 1:5]

# read analog data
a <- c3d_analog(d)
head(a)
```
