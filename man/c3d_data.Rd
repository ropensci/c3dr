\title{Get point data from a c3d object}
\usage{
c3d_data(x, format = "wide")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A c3d object, as imported by \code{\link[=c3d_read]{c3d_read()}}.}

\item{format}{Either \code{"wide"} (default), \code{"long"}, or \code{"longest"} to
determine the format of the resulting data frame. See the Data Formats
section for more details.}
}
\value{
A data frame of class \code{c3d_data} with the c3d point data. The
structure of the data frame depends on the 'format' argument.
}
\description{
Get the point data of an c3d object in a data frame.
}
\details{
The point data of imported c3d objects in \code{c3dr} is saved as a list of lists.
This is good for internal handling, but for analysis a table format (a data
frame) is often more convenient.\code{c3d_data()} returns the point data from an
imported c3d object as a data frame.

Analyses of data frames may require them to have different formats. For
\code{c3d_data} output, different data formats (\code{"wide"}, \code{"long"}, \code{"longest"})
are available. See the section below for more details. You can convert
between different formats with \code{\link[=c3d_convert]{c3d_convert()}}.

\section{Data Formats}{
\subsection{Wide}{

The wide format has three numeric columns per point (x, y, z). The column
names have the structure \code{pointname_type}, so for example the x-coordinate of
a point named \code{C7} has the name \code{C7_x}. Each row corresponds to one recording
frame.
}

\subsection{Long}{

The long format has one column per point. The column names correspond to the
names of the points. Each recording frame corresponds to three rows of data
(x, y, z). In additional to the point columns containing numeric data there
are two additional columns: One that indicates the frame number (\code{frame},
numeric) and one that indicates the coordinate type (\code{type}, either x, y, or
z, as a character).
}

\subsection{Longest}{

The longest format has one data column (\code{value}, numeric). The other columns
indicate the frame number (\code{frame}, numeric), the coordinate type (\code{type},
either x, y, or z, as a character), and the point name (\code{point}, character).
Thus, each row corresponds to one data entry.

# Import example data
d <- c3d_read(c3d_example())

# wide format (default)
w <- c3d_data(d)
head(w)

# long format
l <- c3d_data(d, format = "long")
head(l)

# longest format
ll <- c3d_data(d, format = "longest")
